    "description": "The New Thebes Launch Complex is a spaceport on Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter. It is the primary launch site for the Ganymede Space Agency, which operates a fleet of rockets and spacecraft for scientific research and exploration. The New Thebes Launch Complex is located near the equator of Ganymede, in a region known as the Galileo Regio. The complex consists of a series of launch pads, assembly buildings, and support facilities, as well as a control center for monitoring and coordinating space missions. The New Thebes Launch Complex is named after the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes, which was a center of learning and culture in the ancient world."
