    "description": "Ganymede is the largest moon of Jupiter and one of the most heavily populated locales in the Cradle. It is a nexus of Union culture, science, and industry. First colonized in the immediate precollapse period, it was reinhabited in the in the early 1400s and has since served as a center for Union outer system activities, as well as a major blink gate and omninet nexus. More recently, in the late 4400s, the Jovian minor satellite Cyllene was moved into Ganymede's orbit to serve as a mining base to supply Union's extensive orbital and deep space industry in the region.",
